# project_sonitus

Project Sonitus is the tentitive name for an implementation of modern music theory. It is largely an exercise in programming, and in learning music theory.

The implementation details are designed such that non-standard paradimes in music can be easily implemented, and so that composition in common music "languages" is as easy as possible. Much like a color-picker that shows complimentary colours.

Yes, there's lots of stuff already out there doing stuff like this. No, it's not really very novel. If you're interested, there's even a whole course in Haskell on the subject at Yale. Check out their PDF [HERE](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/Papers/HSoM.pdf).
